##! Horizontal Rule

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

### Example

```md
***

---

_________________
```
***

---

_________________

The rendered output of all three looks identical.
For compatibility, put blank lines before and after horizontal rules.
