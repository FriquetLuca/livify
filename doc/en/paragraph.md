##! Paragraphs

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

### Example
```
I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.
```

Unless the paragraph is in a list, donâ€™t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

### Example
```
    This can result in unexpected formatting problems.

  Don't add tabs or spaces in front of paragraphs.

Contrary to usual markdown, you can write down a sentense and at the next line, another sentense. This won't remove the new line but instead, it will write down a `<br>` tag.

### Example

```md
This is the first sentense.
This is the second sentense still on the same paragraph but at a new line.

This is a new paragraph.
```

This is the first sentense.
This is the second sentense still on the same paragraph but at a new line.

This is a new paragraph.
