##! Blockquote

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

### Example

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

---

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a `>` on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

### Example

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

---

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the paragraph you want to nest.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

Blockquotes can contain other markdown blocks.

```md
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.

For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

Do this:

```
Try to put a blank line before...

> This is a blockquote

...and after a blockquote. 
```

Try to put a blank line before...

> This is a blockquote

...and after a blockquote. 

Don't do this:

```
Without blank lines, this might not look right.
> This is a blockquote
Don't do this! 
```

Without blank lines, this might not look right.
> This is a blockquote
Don't do this!
