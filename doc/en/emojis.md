##! Emoji

There are two ways to add emoji to Markdown files: copy and paste the emoji into your Markdown-formatted text, or type emoji shortcodes.

In most cases, you can simply copy an emoji from a source like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and paste it into your document. Many Markdown applications will automatically display the emoji in the Markdown-formatted text. The HTML files you export from your Markdown application should display the emoji.

This Markdown allow you to insert emoji by typing emoji shortcodes. These begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji.
