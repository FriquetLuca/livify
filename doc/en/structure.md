#! Markdown structure

A Markdown document is organized using a combination of block-level and inline elements to create a clear, readable structure. At its core, it typically includes:

- Headings to define sections (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`)

- Paragraphs for body text

- Lists (ordered and unordered) for grouping items

- Code blocks for displaying code or commands

- Blockquotes for quoting text

- Inline elements like bold, italic, links, and inline code for emphasis and formatting within text

This structure allows writers to create clean, easy-to-read documents that can be rendered as formatted HTML for web use.

##! Block

A block is a distinct section of content that stands on its own, typically separated by one or more blank lines. In Markdown, blocks are used to structure content and include elements such as paragraphs, headers, blockquotes, lists, code blocks, and more. Each block begins on a new line and often follows specific syntax rules to define its type and appearance.

##! Inline {#inline}

Inline refers to content that appears within a line of text, without breaking the flow into a new block. In Markdown, inline elements include formatting like **bold**, *italic*, `code`, [links](#links), and images, all used within a paragraph or sentence. These elements are rendered alongside regular text and do not create standalone sections.
